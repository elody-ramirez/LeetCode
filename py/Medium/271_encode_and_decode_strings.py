# Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string.
# The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded
# back to the original list of strings.

# Example1

# Input: ["lint","code","love","you"]
# Output: ["lint","code","love","you"]
# Explanation:
# One possible encode method is: "lint:;code:;love:;you"

# Example2

# Output: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
# Explanation:
# One possible encode method is: "we:;say:;:::;yes"
